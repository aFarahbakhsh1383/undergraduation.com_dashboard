# ADR-002: Firestore Data Model for Student CRM

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The admin dashboard needs to efficiently store and display each student's journeyâ€”basic info, AI engagement, college applications (with rich college info), essays, activities, documents, and communication.

Firestore structure must balance:
- Easy admin queries/filtering
- Nested, many-to-many, or growing lists (colleges, essays, activities, logs)
- Simplicity for MVP iteration

## Decision

**Main collections:**
- `students` (document per student)
    - Basic info: name, email, phone, school year/grade, gpa, profilePicUrl
    - Academic prefs: preferred majors/states, class size, tuition, scores
    - Docs: profilePicUrl, resumeUrl
    - `interactions` (subcollection)
    - `communications` (subcollection)
    - `notes` (subcollection)
    - `colleges` (subcollection)
        - Info: name, logoUrl, city/state, overview/about, admissions/cost, majors, demographics, outcomes, contacts, ...
    - `essays` (subcollection)
        - prompt, text, status, submittedAt
    - `activities` (subcollection)
        - name, category, description, achievements, timeSpent

### Why subcollections for colleges/essays/activities?
- **Flexibility/scale**: Students may apply to 1 or 100 colleges; essays and activities can grow or be updated independently.
- **Rich details**: Each college can store many fields and related doc info (resume link, essays per application, attachments, etc.).
- **Efficient queries**: Retrieve subsets as needed (eg. list all students applying to a school, batch process only activities).
- **Future-proof**: Enables richer joins, audit logging, multi-admin concurrency.
- **Alignment with Firestore best practice**: Avoids 1MB doc limits and array update conflicts.

### Alternatives considered:
- **Single doc for all (arrays):** Simpler but hits size limits quickly, slower queries, awkward update logic.
- **Cross-student global collections:** Unnecessary for this scope (would use for global colleges list in future).

## Example Structure
- students/{studentId}
    - interactions/{...}
    - notes/{...}
    - communications/{...}
    - colleges/{collegeId}
    - essays/{essayId}
    - activities/{activityId}

## Consequences
- Simple access to summary info (from top-level student doc)
- All CRUD ops for attached records (colleges/essays/activities) are isolated per student
- MVP ready for dashboard; extensible for future app logic!
